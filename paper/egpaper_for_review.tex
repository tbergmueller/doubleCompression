%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top
   of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation
   information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point
   Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially
   capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type.
   Leave two blank lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text.
   Look at previous ICB abstracts to get a feel for style and length. 
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}
Done by Mr. Uhl, including related work?

\section{Test data generation}
TODO: Thomas
\begin{itemize}
 \item Used Database is IITD, because Manual Groundtruth available, as in \cite{severeCompression}
 \item Describe the used methods and implementations
  \begin{itemize}
  \item JPG
  \item JXR
  \item JP2k
  \end{itemize}
 \item Describe the process of single- and double compression
 \item Per-Image quality
 \item Analyze Database and provide quality measures (accuracy, stddev, ...)
 \item Argue that this data base is sufficient
\end{itemize}






\section{Evaluation methods}
Introduction: Thomas


\subsection{Full-referenced quality metrics}
Todo Lefteris:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Which quality metrics were in the selection
 \item Which were chosen
 \item Why have you chosen these
 \item Give a very very brief introduction (rather referencing!) of what the quality metrics are about and the most characteristic features
 \item Results and findings of this evaluation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Segmentation error rates}
TODO TB:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Calculate CR's in bpp
 \item Check whether our method is the same as E1 and/or E2 from this paper: \cite{severeCompression}
 \item If not, impl. E1, is E2 also necessary?
 \item Compare referenced to non-referenced
 \item Comparision
 \item Can we probably use their data to draw longer graphs
 \item Results and Findings of this evaluation
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equal Error rate}
To assess the total impact on the System, the EER is computed
TODO TB

\begin{itemize}
 \item Brief introduction
 \item Results and findings of this evaluation
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}
\subsection{Schnoell-Correlation-method}
TODO: Martin: Introduce your method here and argue why it is better than spearman

\subsection{Correlation of Evaluation methods}
TODO: Martin:
Provide sensible correlation results and analyse


\section{Conclusion}
TODO: Martin Schn√∂ll
